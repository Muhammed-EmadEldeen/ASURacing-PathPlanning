## Procedure

1. **Track Generation**  
   Synthetic cone tracks are generated.

2. **Data Loader Pipeline**  
   - Adds noise to data  
   - Normalizes data:  
     - Aligns batch start at origin  
     - Rotates to face x-axis (vehicle-relative frame)  
   - Handles:
     - Padding and masking when left/right cone arrays differ  
     - Interleaving left and right cones into a single input tensor  
     - Random reversing for clockwise + counter-clockwise diversity  
   - Collates batches

3. **Model Training**  
   A Seq2Seq LSTM-based model is trained to predict the centerline.

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**  
   Results are visualized and compared to ground truth.
